The
official
release
date
of
all
Project
Gutenberg
Etexts
is
at
Midnight,
Central
Time,
of
the
last
day
of
the
stated
month.
A
preliminar
y
version
may
often
be
posted
for
suggestion
,
comment
and
editing
by
those
who
wish
to
do
so.
To
be
sure
you
have
an
up
to
date
first
edition
[xxxxx10x.
xxx]
please
check
file
sizes
in
the
first
week
of
the
next
month.
Since
our
ftp
program
has
a
bug
in
it
that
scrambles
the
date
[tried
to
fix
and
failed]
a
look
at
the
file
size
will
have
to
do,
but
we
will
try
to
see
a
new
copy
has
at
least
one
byte
more
or
less.
Informatio
n
about
Project
Gutenberg
(one
page)
We
produce
about
two
million
dollars
for
each
hour
we
work.
The
fifty
hours
is
one
conservati
ve
estimate
for
how
long
it
we
take
to
get
any
etext
selected,
entered,
proofread,
edited,
copyright
searched
and
analyzed,
the
copyright
letters
written,
etc.
This
projected
audience
is
one
hundred
million
readers.
If
our
value
per
text
is
nominally
estimated
at
one
dollar,
then
we
produce
2
million
dollars
per
hour
this
year
we,
will
have
to
do
four
text
files
per
month:
thus
upping
our
productivi
ty
from
one
million.
The
Goal
of
Project
Gutenberg
is
to
Give
Away
One
Trillion
Etext
Files
by
the
December
31,
2001.
[10,000
x
100,000,00
0=Trillion
]
This
is
ten
thousand
titles
each
to
one
hundred
million
readers,
which
is
10%
of
the
expected
number
of
computer
users
by
the
end
of
the
year
2001.
We
need
your
donations
more

ever!
